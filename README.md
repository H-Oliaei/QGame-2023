# QGame-2023
The QGame event is an exciting opportunity for teams to come together and compete in Quantum Games. The main objective of this event is to prepare these teams for participation in the international Quantum Game Jam, which will be held online in Finland. 

The QGame event will take place online from August 19 to September 13, serving as the second part of the QIran Summer School program. This program aims to bring together enthusiasts and professionals from various fields such as game developers, quantum physicists, visual artists, musicians, coders, and more. By collaborating and working together, these diverse groups will develop games that are connected to the principles of quantum physics.

During the program, participants will utilize the Pygame platform for game development. Pygame is a popular framework that provides tools and resources for creating games using the Python programming language. This platform offers a user-friendly interface and a wide range of features that make it suitable for both beginners and experienced developers.

At the end of the QGame event, teams will have the opportunity to showcase their developed games by uploading them onto the QGame GitHub repository. This repository serves as a central hub where participants can share their creations with others and receive feedback from experts in the field.

Overall, this unique event not only provides an avenue for competition but also fosters collaboration among professionals from different backgrounds. By combining their expertise and creativity, participants have the chance to create innovative games that bridge the gap between quantum physics and gaming.
